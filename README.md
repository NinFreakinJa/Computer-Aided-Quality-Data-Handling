## User Guide
### Directory Configuration
To configure directory paths for the application, use the pathsConfig.json file.
Make sure this file stays within the same directory as CAQDH.exe.
#### Paths
pathsConfig.json is in the format of a list containing sets of input, output, archive paths.  Each set is separated by a comma and in this format:
> {\
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"input_paths": [\
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..\\\\PathToInputDirectory",\
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..\\\\PathToInputDirectory2"\
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],\
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"output_path" : "..\\PathToOutputDirectory",\
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"archive_path": "..\\PathToArchiveDirectory"\
> }\
##### Input Paths
The input_paths characteristic is a comma-separated list of directory paths for the program to watch and pull files for conversion.
##### Output Paths
The output_path characteristic is the path to the directory where the program will output the converted files.
##### Archive Path
The archive_path characteristic is the path to the directory where the program will move the original unconverted file.

CAQDH.exe is compiled using pyinstaller with the single-file command.
> pyinstaller CAQDH.py -F
